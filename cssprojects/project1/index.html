                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
                    served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
                    Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist
                    and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
                    Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
                    programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man
                    of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                    technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
                    India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                    1974.[5]
                    Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
                    after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                    India's highest civilian honour.

                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level
                    dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried
                    with full state honours.[8]
